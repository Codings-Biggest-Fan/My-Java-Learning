# My Java Learning
## Basic Syntax
At The end of each line add a **; (Like In Java Script)**<br>
Pay attention to Upper an lowercase, it matters<br>
Never forget these Starter Lines
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
```
if you dont add these your code wont work
## Printing Text to the Console

If you want to print text in the same line use:
```java
System.out.print("Text");
System.out.print("Another line of Text");
```
The output would look like this:
```
TextAnotherLine of Text
```

If you want to print text in different lines then use:
```java
System.out.println("Text");
System.out.println("Another line of Text");
```
The output would look like this:
```
TextAnotherLine of Text
```
Another way to do this is to add \n into your string like `"Hello\n"`
